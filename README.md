A lightweight game engine built on top of MonoGame.

Work on the engine is just starting out!

Planned Features:
- Scene Management
- Input Management
- Audio Management
- 2D Collision Detection (AABB Tree)
- More to be specified soon!


For now, this engine will be for PC.
After alpha, I'll see into making it work for consoles.
